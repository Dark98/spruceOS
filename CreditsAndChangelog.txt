Changelog Spruce 3.3.0



- Added SamuraiCowboy/Sky_Walker overlays
- DariusGG: bugfix for duplicated virtual keyboard inputs in Fuse core
- DariusGG: Updated Cap32 core to the latest (enables "crop borders" core option)
- Cobalt: Use path traversal for emu launch script, now directly call standard_launch.sh instead of redirect (removed about 75 small files from repo, for slightly faster file transfer to SD card)
- Ry: Add automatic device detection to helperFunctions.sh as part of initial framework for one-card-many-devices.
- Ry+Xan: Add ability to download a _test.7z instead of _info.7z in developer mode, in order to more easily test new additions to Game Nursery without breaking user-facing info cache.
- Ry: correct default icon paths for apps so they don't require an initial iconfresh to show up correctly
- Sundowner Sport: removed Planet Merge to save on MB since it can now easily be downloaded via game Nursery
- Ry: Combined all core switching scripts into one, for clearer code, less code duplication, and easier maintenance. Core switch script now also has better logging and is more resistant to broken states; now it will work even if emu_setup.sh was never run for some reason, or if a system's .opt file or config.json was tampered with.
- Ry: ditto ^ for CPU speed as well
- Fengfrw: fixed error in development for CPU clock changes.
- XanXic: Added a quick restart for the main menu in designer mode (Xan)
- XanXic: Bugfix: Fixed an interaction when using home as a hotkey that would fire multiple actions (Xan)
- XanXic: Added caching to the Game Nursery, release info will now be good for 20 minutes when re-opening the nursery (Xan)
- XanXic: Perfect Overlays: Added a new toggle in Advanced Settings to apply Perfect Overlays provided by 1PlayerInsertCoin and Mugwomp93, with direct input from Mugwomp! With just a toggle your GB, GBC, and GBA will be configured to use these with the exact settings they need. You can then customize it from there if you wish. Can be toggled off just as easily, try them out. (Xan, Mugwomp93, 1PlayerInsertCoin)
- XanXic: Enabled Fast Foward on R2 while playing GB, GBC, and GBA games. This doesn't affect hotkeys. (Xan)
- XanXic: Added sharp-shimmerless shader to RetroArch (Xan)
- XanXic: Excluded PSX from the 'Rewind in RetroArch' setting since it had huge performance issues (Dandon)
- Cobalt: Added boot into Splore setting (Cobalt)
- Cobalt: Bugfix: Spruce will now check for wifi before starting Splore (Cobalt)
- Fragbait: Added a new SD Card error detection and fixing tool (Fragbait)
- XanXic: Showing OTA app by default
- Ry: Generalized ThemeUnpacker into just... Unpacker. Users (or we) can now put .7z files containing full paths (/mnt/SDCARD/whatever-you're-packing) in the spruce/archives folder on the SD card, and they will be unpacked on boot.
- Dandon: Excluded PSX from the 'Rewind in RetroArch' setting since it had huge performance issues
- Dandon: Update SSH and Samba authentication to match SFTP
- Dandon: Random.sh now works again
- Dandon: Update PPSSPP hotkeys to match RetroArch
- Dandon: Add option to reset PPSSPP configuration to Advanced Settings
- XanXic + Dandon: New network services landing page added to base ip address for the device (dandon, XanXic)
- Kickbut101: add favorites option added to X menu
- 369px: [Bugfix] after updating, custom themes wonâ€™t get replaced anymore 
- Ry: Added a "custom system" Emu folder that advanced users can modify or use as a template for adding additional RA-based systems to the games menu. (One use case might be splitting out Daphne games from Dreamcast, or MSX2 games from MSX.)

    Modifying the config.json and config.json.simple will allow them to set things like the display name, the icons being used for the new system, and allowed file extensions to show up in the games list.

    Modifying default.opt will allow them to set which RA core they wish to use and the minimum CPU speed while in Smart CPU mode.
    If spruce does not ship with the desired RA core, or you wish to use a different version of a spruce-included core, you may optionally add a compatible version of that core with a name matching what you have set in default.opt to the custom system's Emu folder, and it will use that instead of whatever is in spruce's RetroArch cores folder.

    Because the names people give to these systems may vary widely, spruce cannot and will not back these emulator configs up. Please keep your own backups for reinstallation after system upgrades.
