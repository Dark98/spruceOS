Changelog Spruce 3.1.0


Changes/Additions:

* OTA Updater: (Aka Over the air updates, or Spruce Updater) Added our own updater, this will download and install the latest release from our GitHub releases page. Starting from 3.1.0 on you no longer need to manually update. It will be in your apps under "Check for Updates" or if an update is available.. "Update available". After a fresh install this app will be hidden, you can show it if you like in the Advanced Settings visibility toggles. Combined with the auto-update checker, detailed below, you could go without seeing it until an update is available. But this can be ran at anytime to manually check for new updates. The app will download the newest release and will run the EZUpdater app to install it. You can also choose to download and install later through EZ Updater if you wish. This leverages our previous work so your configs and settings are kept. (XanXic)
* Auto update checker: A new advanced setting, if you have this, on by default, and wifi on, after a new startup Spruce will check if an update is available occasionally. If so it'll add the updater app to your apps and give you notice next time you reboot. (XanXic)
* Home key controls: Added new settings to define what tap and hold of the home/menu key does. Now you can make your own setup for what it does. (Oscar)
* Added new quick exit action to the tap/hold home key options (Oscar)
* Reduced 'hold' time for the home key to 1.6 seconds from 2, added vibration when hold 'fires' (XanXic)
* Sleep then shutdown: Added automatic shutdown after x minutes in sleep feature (FragBait)
* Added new vibration strength/off setting in advanced settings (Ry, XanXic)
* Fake08: Added enable .png support setting (Ry)
* Pico 8: Added new controller layouts setting so you can decide how the buttons work, also added a 'full screen' setting for Pico8 (Ry)
* Added on board QR generator, expect errors to give QR codes directly to wiki topics in the future. For now this is how OTA Updates will link you to the changelogs (FragBait)
* Added SFTP, over SSH (FragBait)
* Bluelight Filter: Added in advanced setting, this is our initial attempt, we will dial this in and add sceduling in a future update. It’s manual for now. (FragBait)
* Changed default Lynx core to Handy (Cobalt)
* Syncthing: Greatly improved Syncthing Sync Checker times across the board for all scenarios with the total sync process taking anywhere from nearly instant to 5 seconds now, down from 13 seconds. (BaseInfinity)
* Added QuickNes emulator for NES systems (Cobalt)
* Added gearcoleco RA core for Colecovision emulation (Thanks jonnyandroid for the suggestion) (Ry)
* Added an automatic cleanup script to remove apostrophe's (') from sub folder names in roms. These are incompatible with MainUI (Ry)
* Added automatic save and shutdown when battery hits less than 1%. Both to save your game and prevent an issue with soft bricked battery (Ry)
* Stick delete: Added an option to disable joystick in settings for stick delete modders (Oscar)
* Added “designer mode” to show all consoles and give access to our Theme Packer app so theme creators can have an easier time. Check the information for creating themes on our wiki (XanXic)
* Themed SFTPGo/Wifi file transfer with spruce elements and A30's (Veckia9x)
* Added and cleaned up icons for new and existing apps (SundownerSport)
* Some advanced settings options shifted around. We are still feeling this app out as we expand on it, so please bear with us release to release as we find the best setup (Team Effort)
* Removed genesis+gx core as option from 32x that Ry added erroneously (Cobalt)
* Added developer_mode for easy toggle of dev-useful settings that differ from the defaults we ship with (fragbait)
* Added sleep -> shutdown option as a further power-saving measure (FragBait)
* Reduced default time for vibrate() to reduce intensity (XanXic)
* Added chd to extlist for PSP (thanks HeyDW!) (Ry)
* Changed default Lynx core to handy (Cobalt)
* Added rumble intensity (Strong/Medium/Weak/Off) advanced setting for system notifications (Ry)
* Added user-customisable actions for tap/long-press of HOME key (game switcher/in-game menu/exit game) (Oscar)
* Fixed NDS joystick issue (Oscar)
* Replace keymon with scripts "buttons_watchdog.sh"  this solves the following issues:
1) update volume and brightness level to config file once they are changed by using hotkey or volune buttons
2) no brightness and volume flicking when changing them with hotkey or volume buttons
3) disable original auto sleeping feature (Oscar)
* Reduced home key long press detection to 1.6 (XanXic)
* Added vibration when long press of home key is fired (XanXic)
* Expanded helper methods for working with the spruce.cfg file (XanXic)
* Moved Idlemon, sleep power down, and rumble settings into the spruce.cfg file and following the established patterns (XanXic)
* Added a "Rumble preview" when adjusting the vibration setting (XanXic)
* Expanded developer mode to do a few more things, added a developer mode 'reapply' task to settings when the flag is present (XanXic)
* Added a designer mode that does all the things dev mode does but will run emufresh in a show all mode (XanXic)
* Moved Emulator settings into separate tab within Advanced Settings App (Ry)
* Added toggle to enable .png file support for Fake08; coincidentally sets Fake08 box art to use the cart itself, mimicking our Pico-8 config (Ry)
*     Added a new Advanced Setting to have different controller profiles for Pico-8. (Ry)
        Racing - this is the current default since spruce 3.0.0:
            A-(o) B-(x) L1-(o) R1-(x)
        Double - this is my personal preference:
            A-(o) B-(x) Y-(o) X-(x)
        One-handed - Allows most games to be played with only the left hand:
            A-(o) B-(x) L1-(o) L2-(x)
        Steward - Legacy mode from pre-3.0.0; only one set of O and X, but also enables a unique mouse mode and access to the ESC key, which the SDL2 version that enables gamepad mapping does not have access to.
            A-(o) B-(x) X-(esc) SELECT-(mouse)
* Fix uae4arm audio sync (Metallic77)
* Changes in Setting App for simpler and more transparent config file (Oscar)
* Added new advanced setting to stretch native Pico-8 to fullscreen (Ry)
* Added fix to automatically rename Roms subfolders with apostrophes in their names (once, on boot before first emufresh) so that MainUI can see them (Ry)
* Added gearcoleco RA core as option for Colecovision emulation (thanks jonnyandroid for the suggestion) (Ry)
* Added config override for fake08 core to disable auto save and auto load states, to prevent users from getting locked out of their games if they accidentally hit “reset game” or “exit to menu” inside fake08 (Ry)
* Added new Advanced Setting: Low power warning percent (Off/4%/8%/12%/16%/20%). Low power warning now also respects the global Rumble Intensity setting (Ry)
* Added Qrencode for QR code generation (FragBait)
* Removing AutoRA flag in AutoRa to try and prevent AutoRa loops (XanXic)
* Added a forced shutdown at or below 1% battery in order to ensure that users' auto save states get created (Ry)
* Exposed QuickNES emulator core to UI for NES system (Cobalt)
* Restyled WiFi File App page to match device and SpruceOS icons (Veckia9x)
* Added Romanian language (VladNerd)
* Added sftp (over ssh) (fragbait)
* Added Tester mode, testers skip version checks on OTA's, updates, and upgrades. They can donload the latest nightlies (Dev, and Designer do this as well) (XanXic)
* Added a restore RetroArch hotkeys task (XanXic)
* Improved low power warning functionality (XanXic)
* Changed how recents menu is shown/hidden, made restore compatible with new style (XanXic)
* Removed a number of unnecessary per-core and per-system RA config overrides, which will make modifying global RA configs easier for users in many situations (Ry)
* Added Noto.ttf to spruce/Font Files/ for people to use for Cyrillic langs (SundownerSport)

Bugfixes/Removals:

* Fix uae4arm audio sync issues (Metallic77)

* Fixed a network/wifi broken state issue when disabling WiFi and Network Service in game (BaseInfinity)

* PPSSPP now emulates inserted memorystick (fragbait)
* Greatly improved Syncthing Sync Checker times across the board for all scenarios with the total sync process taking anywhere from nearly instant to 5 seconds now, down from 13 seconds (BaseInfinity)
