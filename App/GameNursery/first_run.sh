display --okay -i "$BG_IMG" -t "Games hosted in the Nursery are organized into groups based on the system they were made for. Press L1 and R1 to tab through these groups."

display --okay -i "$BG_IMG" -t "You can think of selecting games to download from the Nursery like a shopping cart; browse the games at your leisure, adding them to and removing them from your 'cart' as you go. Once you exit the app, your selections will all be downloaded and installed in sequence."

display --okay -i "$BG_IMG" -t "Games that you do not already have installed will display a brief description underneath them. If you highlight a game and press A, it will change to indicate that it will be installed."

display --okay -i "$BG_IMG" -t "Games that you have already installed previously can also be easily reinstalled through this same interface, in the event that your previous installation has gone wrong."

display --okay -i "$BG_IMG" -t "The spruce team has the utmost respect for the developers of these games, and strives to comply with the respective license terms for each game in our collection."

display --okay -i "$BG_IMG" -t "We are happy to share some of our favorite ports and homebrew games with you, and hope you enjoy your Game Nursery experience. Happy gaming!"
